## 1. Acceptance

By using Datly you agree to these Terms of Service and the Datly Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, do not use the service.

## 2. Service description

Datly is a free service that allows approved users to capture and upload photos. Uploaded photos are used to train, evaluate, and improve AI/ML models. There is no other feature beyond image collection and related model development.

## 3. Registration & accounts

- There is **no public self-registration**: accounts are created and approved manually by administrators.
- Usernames are assigned by admins and are **not changeable** by users.
- You are responsible for keeping any account credentials secure and for all activity performed under your account.

## 4. Eligibility & lawful use

- You must be legally able to agree to these Terms and to give consent to image processing under applicable law. The service is not intended for children.
- You must only upload images you have the right to upload (you own the copyright or have permission from the copyright owner) and you must have the necessary consents from any identifiable person depicted in images where required by law.

## 5. User content & license

- You retain ownership of images you upload. By uploading you grant Datly the license described in our Privacy Policy to use the images for training and related research/development.
- You promise that uploaded content does not infringe third-party rights, is not illegal, and does not contain prohibited content (child sexual abuse material, hate speech, non-consensual intimate imagery, etc.). We reserve the right to remove content that violates these Terms.

## 6. Prohibited conduct

Do not use Datly to upload illegal content or to upload images in a way that violates privacy or other rights. We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms.

## 7. Deletion & account closure

You may request deletion of your account and original uploaded images by contacting **<me@jhubi1.com>**. We will remove originals and exclude them from future training where technically feasible; however, we cannot guarantee removal of information already irreversibly incorporated into a deployed model.

## 8. Fees

Datly is provided free of charge unless we state otherwise in a future update. If fees are introduced, they will be communicated and explicitly agreed to.

## 9. Disclaimers & liability

- The service is provided “as is”. We disclaim all warranties to the fullest extent permitted by law.
- To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, JHubi1’s liability for direct damages is limited to any amounts paid to us in the 12 months prior to the claim (if any); JHubi1 is not liable for indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages.

## 10. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold JHubi1 harmless from claims arising from your violation of these Terms or your uploads.

## 11. Changes to the Terms

We may modify these Terms. Significant changes will be communicated via the app or email (if you provided one). Continued use after such changes constitutes acceptance.

## 12. Governing law & jurisdiction

These Terms are governed by the laws of **Germany**. Where you are a consumer, mandatory consumer-protection rules in your jurisdiction remain applicable.

## 13. Contact

For questions, account requests, deletion requests or other matters contact: **<me@jhubi1.com>** (maintainer: JHubi1).
