# Datly — Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** 2025-12-14
**Maintainer / Controller:** JHubi1  
**Contact:** <me@jhubi1.com>  
**Location:** Germany

## Quick summary

- Datly lets approved users take photos and upload them to our servers. Uploaded photos are used **only** to train, evaluate, and improve AI/ML models.  
- Accounts are created and approved manually by administrators. Usernames are assigned by admins and are **not changeable** by users.  
- We currently collect **no other personal data by default**. An email address may be collected in the future for optional notifications, but email addresses and usernames will **not** be included in any training datasets.  
- All uploaded images have embedded metadata (EXIF) removed before they are stored (data minimisation).  
- Access to the service is **free**.

## 1. Controller & contact

The data controller for processing carried out via Datly is the maintainer listed above (JHubi1). For questions, privacy requests, or to exercise your rights contact: **<me@jhubi1.com>**.

## 2. What we collect

- **Images you upload.** This includes the image file content; however, embedded metadata (EXIF, GPS, camera model, etc.) is removed before the file is stored.  
- **Account identifiers.** A username (admin-assigned). Optionally an email address only if you voluntarily provide it for notifications; emails are not used in training datasets.  
- **Minimal administrative data.** Status/approval timestamps and basic logs required to manage accounts and moderate uploads.

We do **not** collect unrelated personal data (contact lists, device address books, payment data, health or sensitive category data as a matter of design). Do not upload photos that contain sensitive personal data about others unless you have lawful consent.

## 3. Purpose & legal bases for processing

**Primary purpose:** to store and process images for the development, training, evaluation and improvement of AI/ML models and related research/benchmarks.

**Legal bases (Article 6 GDPR):**

- **Consent (Art. 6(1)(a))** — for processing images you actively upload for training purposes we rely on your explicit informed consent at the time of upload. Consent is freely given, specific and can be withdrawn.  
- **Legitimate interests / contract (Art. 6(1)(f)/(b))** — for account management, fraud prevention, security and maintaining the service we rely on legitimate interests and contract where applicable (e.g., if you opt into optional notifications). We will document any legitimate-interests assessment where required.

If the legal basis for a particular processing step differs, we will make that clear at the point of collection.

## 4. What you grant us (license & model use)

By uploading an image you grant Datly a **non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, transferable and sublicensable** license to store, reproduce, analyse, transform (including anonymisation/feature extraction), and use the image and any derived data for training, validating, evaluating and improving AI/ML models and for associated research and development. This includes use in internal or external publications or benchmarks in de-identified or aggregated form.

**Important:** We will remove EXIF/embedded metadata before storage. If you request deletion we will delete original files and take steps to exclude them from future training; however, information that has already been irreversibly incorporated into a trained model may not be fully removable. We will make reasonable efforts to prevent further use of deleted images in subsequent training. The legal limits to erasing information already learned by models are described in the GDPR (right to erasure and practical limitations).

## 5. Retention

- Default retention for original uploaded images: **up to 24 months** from upload, unless you request earlier deletion.  
- If you request account deletion we will remove original image files and account data (except logs necessary for security, legal compliance, or backup retention) within **30 days** where technically feasible. We will exclude your images from future training and datasets after deletion.  
- Backup copies or limited logs may be retained longer only for legal, security or backup-restoration purposes; such data will be minimised and access restricted.

These retention periods are chosen to balance model development needs and data minimisation/storage limitation obligations under the GDPR.

## 6. Data subject rights & exercising them

Under the GDPR you have rights including (where applicable):  

- Right to be informed (this notice), access, rectification, erasure (right to be forgotten), restriction of processing, objection, data portability, and rights related to automated decision-making. We will assist you to exercise these rights and respond within GDPR timeframes.

To exercise any right, contact **<me@jhubi1.com>**. We may require reasonable proof of identity before fulfilling requests.

You may also withdraw any consent you gave for image use at any time; withdrawal will not affect processing already lawfully completed prior to withdrawal.

## 7. Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)

Processing personal images to train AI can be a high-risk activity. Where required by the GDPR, Datly will carry out a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) before or when launching processing operations that are likely to result in a high risk to data subjects (for example large-scale profiling or certain AI uses). You may request summary information about any DPIA we have carried out.

## 8. Security

We use appropriate technical and organisational measures (access controls, encryption in transit, minimal admin access, secure hosting practices) to protect stored images and account data. While we aim to protect your data, no system is absolutely secure. In the unlikely event of a personal data breach requiring notification, we will follow GDPR notification obligations.

## 9. International transfers

Data may be processed or stored outside the EU/EEA (e.g., by hosting or ML service providers). Where we transfer personal data outside the EEA we will apply appropriate safeguards (e.g., EU Standard Contractual Clauses or other lawful transfer mechanisms) as required by GDPR.

## 10. Sharing & subprocessors

We use trusted subprocessors to store and process data. Specifically, our primary hosting provider is **Hetzner Online GmbH**, located in **Nuremberg, Germany (eu-central)**, where we utilize a private shared server environment. Subprocessors are contractually required to process data only on our instructions and to implement appropriate safeguards. We may share de-identified or aggregated research outputs or models; usernames and email addresses will **not** be included in training datasets or shared model artifacts.

## 11. Minors

Datly is **not intended** for children. By using the service you represent that you meet the minimum age in your jurisdiction to give consent for image uploads. Do not upload images of minors unless you have lawful permission.

## 12. Complaints & supervisory authority

If you have an unresolved complaint about our processing you may contact your national data protection authority. In Germany you may contact the relevant state supervisory authority or the Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (BfDI) for federal matters. Filing a complaint with a supervisory authority is free of charge.

## 13. Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this policy; material changes will be communicated via the app or by email if you have provided one. The latest effective date will be displayed at the top.

## 14. Misc / legal

This notice is intended to describe core practices and is not a substitute for legal advice. For legal questions about obligations under GDPR or other national laws please consult a qualified attorney.
